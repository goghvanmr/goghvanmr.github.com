[*Julian Assange, the Unauthorised Autobiography*](http://book.douban.com/subject/6920102/)一书记录了阿桑奇童年时候的一个有趣的小故事。大概就是，小阿桑奇一度不喜欢他的意大利邻居，不喜欢他们破坏房前花花草草的行为。因此他产生了一些偏见。一次，小阿桑奇家做饭缺西红柿，他妈妈问意大利邻居借却遭到了拒绝。这下可惹到了小阿桑奇。他伙同小伙伴，挖了一条地道过去，偷了两筐西红柿回来。当他把这两筐西红柿给妈妈时，妈妈笑了；后来警察来了，他们也笑了。结果是，赃物只追回了一半。

我很喜欢这个故事，因为它很温情。试想这件事情发生在大部分的中国家庭里，妈妈会笑吗？警察会笑吗？我想，妈妈多半会骂你，说你这么小都会偷东西了长大了还得了，不揍你一顿就是便宜你了；警察多半会弯上身子来瞪大眼睛说下次再这样就把你关进监狱。大人对小孩的态度中，老是充满了轻蔑、欺骗与恐吓。

总是很羡慕那些有着美好童年的人，他们的成长要顺利很多。童年的阴影也许会伴随我一辈子，它也会时刻提醒我，以后要做一个好父亲，也要尊重每一个遇到的小孩。

下面附上这个故事的原文：
>Within the little gangs I headed up we had our share of children’s wisdom and a whole stack of prejudice. At one time, I think we felt the Italians were a sort of adversary. They had this habit of paving. They’d buy a house with bougainvillea outside, this wonderful blush of colour, and would immediately clear it all and pave the garden and put up Doric columns. I’m ashamed of it now, but I took against this. It seemed important to me then to take a stand against this thing. I was probably the kind of child who was shopping for things to take a stand against. I remember one day my folks were making dinner and found they were short of tomatoes. The Italian neighbours had loads of tomatoes. My mother had asked for some and had been refused, and this got to me. So the next day I began digging a tunnel from our garden to theirs. I got some of my little gang involved, bringing shovels and candles to get the job done. It was hard work, but we got under the fence in secret and came away with two baskets of tomatoes. I handed one of them to my mother and she had this grin. We waited to see what would happen, and what happened was that two policemen quickly turned up at the door and they, too, were grinning. The policeman just stood there rocking on their heels. It was my first run-in with the law. We handed back one basket of tomatoes, and the scandal reverberated. But I was happy that I still had the second basket of tomatoes hidden.
