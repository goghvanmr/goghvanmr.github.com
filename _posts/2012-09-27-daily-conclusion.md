### Baidu

I got rejeted by Baidu's campus recruiting project. That makes me feel regretful. If I had prepared that seriously, the result wouldn't be the same. 

But I've no time for depression and endless regret. Life's full of wonderful things, right?

### Python

charset drives me crazy… 

### CS101

I start following this online course from today. Lesson one is not difficult, but it gives me an interesting computer-oriented mindset: programming is communication with computer. Interesting.
